# PrimeTest

Here are some codes to test whether a given integer is prime based Miller-Rabin algorithm.
Thanks to the awesome algorithm,in theory,you could change the parameter of `initBaseNumber` to test infinity integer\
usage:
```
git clone https://github.com/sjl623/PrimeTest.git
cd PrimeTest
make
./main
```

# NOTICE #[h
*the [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) library is required.*
*by the way,enable c++ suport when you install [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) by --enable-cxx is also needed.[here](https://gmplib.org/manual/Build-Options.html#Build-Options) is more details*
